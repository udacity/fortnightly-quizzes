**Q1**: You have two `nupmy` arrays `a` and `b`, both with shape (784,). Which of the following will create a matrix `c` of shape (2,784), with `a` in its first row and `b` in the second row?

1. `c = np.hstack((a,b))`
2. `c = np.vstack(a,b)`
3. `c = np.stack((a,b),0)`
4. `c = np.concatenate((a,b))`

**Answer:2**


**Q2:** Which is/are the right way to transpose the numpy array X:

```
>>> X
array([[ 0.51781407,  0.40376168,  0.02014567,  0.79970514,  0.47814232],
       [ 0.4582631 ,  0.86805083,  0.98025586,  0.62839894,  0.91543721]])

```

1. X.shape = (5,2)
2. X.T
3. X = X.transpoose()
4. X = np.transpose(X)

**Answer: 3,4**
