**Q1**: You have two `nupmy` arrays `a` and `b`, both with shape (784,). Which of the following will create a matrix `c` of shape (2,784), with `a` in its first row and `b` in the second row?

1. `c = np.hstack((a,b))`
2. `c = np.vstack(a,b)`
3. `c = np.stack((a,b),0)`
4. `c = np.concatenate((a,b))`

**Answer:2**


**Q2:** Which is/are the right way to transpose the numpy array X:

```
>>> X
array([[ 0.51781407,  0.40376168,  0.02014567,  0.79970514,  0.47814232],
       [ 0.4582631 ,  0.86805083,  0.98025586,  0.62839894,  0.91543721]])

```

1. X.reshape((5,2))
2. X.T
3. X = X.transpoose()
4. X = np.transpose(X)

**Answer: 3,4**


**Q3:** Which of the following is/are valid ways of squaring every elemment of a matrix `M`?

1. `M **= 2`
2. `M .^ 2`
3. `M.dot(M.T)`
4. `M = np.matmul(M,M.T)`

**Answer: 1**


**Q4:** Given `y = W*x`, where `y` has shape (n,1), `x` has shape (m,1) and `W` has shape (n,m), if we want to find x from y, what is the numpy code for doing so?

1. `x  = np.invert(W)*y`
2. `x  = W**-1.0 * y`
3. `x  = 1.0/W * y`
4. `x = numpy.linalg.inv(W)*y`

**Answer:4**

**Q5:** Which is the right way to extract odd rows from a numpy array `A` with shape (500,784)?
1. A[0::1, :]
2. A[::2, :]
3. A[:2:, :]
4. A[1::2, :]

**Answer:4**
