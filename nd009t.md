**Q1:** When the code below is run, the final position of all robots is same. Which function contains a bug causing this anamoly?

```python
class robot(object):
    def __init__(self,x,y,theta):
        self.x = x
        self.y = y
        self.theta = theta

    def rotate(self, theta):
        self.theta = theta

    def move(self, speed, time):
        self.x += speed * np.cos(self.theta) * time
        self.y += speed * np.sin(self.theta) * time

    def __str__(self):
        return str(np.round(self.x,2))+','+str(np.round(self.y,2))


def test_robots():        
    r1, r2, r3 = [robot(0,0,0)]*3
    r2.rotate(np.pi/2)
    r3.rotate(np.pi)
    r1.move(2,1);r2.move(1,3);r3.move(3,2)
    print(f"{r1},{r2},{r3}")

test_robots()
```


1. `robot.rotate()`
2. `robot.move()`
3. `robot.__str__()`
4. `test_robots()`

**Answer:4**


**Q2**: Which sequence of git commands would result in the commit graph changing from:
![](git1.png)

to 

![](git2.png)

1. git checkout -b bugfix > git commit > git branch master > git commit > git merge
2. git checkout -b bugfix > git commit > git checkout master > git commit > git merge
3. git commit > git branch bugfix > git checkout bugfix > git commit > git merge master
4. git commit > git branch bugfix > git checkout bugfix > git commit > git checkout master > git pull bugfix

**Answer:4**


**Q3**: Which of the four options is semantically equivalent to the code below but is more readable:

```
result_x = []
result_y = []
for x in list1:
    for y in list2:
    if prob(x)*prob(y) > 1e-4:
        result_x.append(x)
        result_y.append(y)
```       

1.
```
z = [(x,y) for x in list1 for y in list2]
f = filter(lambda a ,b: prob(a)*prob(b) > 1e-4, z)
u = zip(*f)
result_x, result_y = map(list, u)
```
2.
```
z = [(x,y) for x in list1 for y in list2]
f = filter(lambda t: prob(t[0])*prob(t[1]) > 1e-4, z)
u = zip(*f)
result_x, result_y = map(list, u)
```

3.
```
z = zip(list1, list2)
f = filter(lambda t: prob(t[0])*prob(t[1]) > 1e-4, z)
u = zip(*f)
result_x, result_y = map(list, u)
```

4.
```
z = zip(list1, list2)
f = filter(lambda a, b: prob(a)*prob(b) > 1e-4, z)
u = zip(*f)
result_x, result_y = map(list, u)
```
**Answer:2**


**Q4:** Suppose you discover a new unsupervised learning algorithm similar to PCA. The algorithm can be trained on a dataset and discovers new dimesnions on to which an existing dataset can be projected to get new features. You want to contribute your algorith to the sklearn codebase. Which of the following APIs should an implementation of the algorithm provide?

1. fit(), fit_predict(), fit_transform(), predict(), transform()
2. fit(), fit_predict(), predict()
3. fit(), fit_transform(), transform()
4. fit(), fit_transform()

**Answer:3**


**Q5:** Which of the following git command will fix a typo in the last commit without creating a new commit?


1. 
```git checkout head^ 
git merge master -m 'new commit message'
```

2.
```
git revert 
git commit -m 'new commit message'
```

3.
```
git commit --amend -m 'new commit message'
```

4.
```
git reset head^
git commit -m 'new commit message'
```

**Answer:3**
