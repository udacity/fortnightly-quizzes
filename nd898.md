**Q4:** You want to build a house along a road. Let the milestones on the road be represented by integers from -127 to 127. A property can only be built at a milestone and a milestone can have only one property situated at it. You decide you want to buy the house beween milestone -2, where your office has been built, and milestone +4 where your gym has been built. You want the sum of distances from your house to both these places to be no more than 8 units. How many possible locations are there for building the house?

1. 9
2. 7
3. 256
4. 254

**Answer:2**


**Q5:** You are given a list of lists of files:
```
file_list = [ [ 'center/image1.png','center/image2.png', 'center/image3.png' ], [ 'left/image11.png', 'left/image17.png', 'left/image2.png', 'left/image30.png' ], [ 'right/image5.jpg', 'right/image6.png' ] ]
```
Which of the following will create a single list of all filepaths?

1. `file_list_flattened = [ filepath for filepath in filepaths for filepaths in file_list ]`
2. `file_list_flattened = [ filepath for filepaths in file_list for filepath in filepaths ]`
3. `file_list_flattened = [ filepath for filepath in zip(*file_list) ]`
4. `file_list_flattened = [ filepath for filepath in filelist]`

**Q2:** When performing a tree search, which of the following is true regarding breadth first search (BFS) and depth first search(DFS), uniform cost search(UCS)?

1. BFS will find any node in a tree faster than DFS
2. DFS will find any node in a tree faster than BFS
3. DFS is guaranteed to visit the subtree of a node, before visiting the node.
4. BFS will visit all nodes at depth d, before any node at depth d+1 is visited.

**Answer:4**

**Q3:** Which of the following is true regarding search algorithms applied to a graph with weighted edges?

1. BFS can find the shortest path to a node but DFS may not.
2. Both BFS and DFS will find the shortest path but will be considerably slower than UCS.
3. BFS and DFS are not guranteed to find the shortest path in a graph with edge weights.
4. Only UCS is guaranteed to generate the shortest path.

**Answer:4**

**Q4:** Which of the following is true for A* algorithm?

1. A* will visit all nodes in a graph.
2. A* is guaranteed to explore fewer nodes than UCS
3. A* is a variation of uniform cost search, where the cost includes a heuristic estimate too.
4. A* may fail to find a path even if one exists.

**Answer:3**

**Q5:** When applying search algorithms to design a board game playing agent

1. The nodes of the search tree are the moves.
2. The edges of the search tree represent the state of the board.
3. The search tree is generally built iteratively as the game progresses.
4. The algorithm needs to simulate the game to the end to find the next move.

**Answer:3**
